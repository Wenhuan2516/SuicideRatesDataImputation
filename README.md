# SuicideRatesDataImputation
## This project is to assign the average suicide rates of adjacent counties to the counties that don't have suicide death record. Here I used 2015 suicide death data 
## that was downloaded from CDC Wonder- Underlying Cause of Death: https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html

### The county adjacent data is downloaded from Census.gov: 
#### https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2010/geo/county-adjacency.html#:~:text=The%20county%20adjacency%20file%20lists%20each%20county%2C%20or,Mariana%20Islands%2C%20Guam%2C%20and%20the%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands%29.

#### by using some algorithms, I created a list of county fips of adjacent counties and they are shown in the data frame with a column called Neighbor Code:
